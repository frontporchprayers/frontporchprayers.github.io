> “Don’t collect for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal. But collect for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves don’t break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.”

I am going through our basement storage clutter. Old notebooks from our college days, outdated catalogues, pieces of long forgotten toys, and manuals to items we no longer own are filling trash bags and going to the curb. Some items can be added to my kitchen and office supplies I will repurpose.

But among the garbage, I am uncovering some hidden treasures! I’ve found cards and photos from family and friends, and love notes from my husband and boys. I’ve also found pages of scripture hand written by my mother-in-law in years past.

The memories of people and emotions of times spent together are what we treasure, we can hang onto a box of these treasures and put some out on display, but we cannot take them to Heaven. Only what we store in our heart, our spirit, will go with us.

**Prayer:**
> Dear Lord,
> 
> Thank you for the provisions you have given to me. Please help me to use them well and to bless others with items they need. Help me to hold my  possessions lightly and fix my heart toward heaven and eternity with You.

**Journal:** 
What possessions are you holding too tightly? Where is your heart focused?
